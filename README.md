# School Management üè´
This project consumes the [School API](https://github.com/wnicolass/students-api), so to use it you need to configure the API on your computer.

Copy the .env.example file to .env and replace:
```bash
REACT_APP_BASE_URL='API-URL-HERE' # it would be http://localhost:3001 if you have followed the api instructions
```

Run the following commands:

```bash
npm i # install all packages
npm start
```

At this point, the project should be running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/.

Enjoy! :wave:
